## Fundamental
HTML - HTML stands for Hyper Text Mrkup Language. It is used to give a structure to a website. A HTML document contains only 2 things Head and Body and the rest of the code is written in these two elements.  
Inside the 'head' element we can performs various tasks such as:  
1. 'title' tag - This gives the web page a title at the top.
2. Favicon - This is the icon near the title of the page.
3. We can also link the CSS and Javascript page here using:  
   "link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" - FOR CSS"  
   and "script src="myscripts.js"></script - FOR JavaScript"   

Now comes the 'body' element and inside it we perform the tasks that are visible on the webpage. Some of these are:  
1. h1 to h6 tags: These are the heading tags. The 'h1' tag is the biggest tag and the 'h6' tag is the smallest tag. 
2. 'p' tag: This is the paragtaph tag. This is used to write normal text.
3. 'br' tag: This is the break tag. This does not have any closing tag.
4. 'a' tag: This tag is used to link one page to another. We use an attribute inside it known as 'link'.

Then there are many other tags like 'b' tag for bold text, 'div' tag, 'ol' tags for ordered list and many more.  
The point of attention is that almost every tag has a closing tag expect few like the 'br' tag which does not have any closing tag.
