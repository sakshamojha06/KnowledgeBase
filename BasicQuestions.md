## BASIC QUESTIONS123
#### Q1. How do search engine work so fast?   
Distributed computing. Search engines have hundreds of thousands of more servers around the world. Each search is spread across multiple    servers, eliminating potential bottlenecks. If all the info had to come from a single server that might be busy when you make the search.   
#### Q2. Will computer programming jobs be taken over by AI within the next 5-10 years?   
AI hasen't put humans out of business as much as it has made us much more productive and efficient. Using these tools to support the clients for whom we're building products, we can solve so many more problems and move forward together at an even faster rate.   
#### Q3. How do microchips even work? Like it's just a green piece of metal.   
Microchips are on a logic or motherboards that has many ports (audio, networking, USB, etc.). These ports connect to different chips(via traces or tiny wires) that know how to interpret signals from those ports. Some perform operations, some store information.   
#### Q4. So if anyone can learn coding, what do computer scientists do for 4 years in university?   
Students will learn much more about the field itself than programming specifically. Computer science is really all about solving problems. You might also study mathematics, networks, graphics, and artificial intelligence.   
#### Q5. How do zeros and ones turn into the internet?   
The internet is built upon layers of ideas. At the lowest layer, zeros and ones(binary), can be used to represent other numbers, letters, color, etc. This can eventually form a pattern that represents "send this indo from me to there" and we have something like the internet.   
#### Q6. Can someone who knows computer science explain to me why computers use binary coding and not trinary when trinary is supposed to be faster?   
It would actually be less efficient to use more digits. Binary is simpler to implement and more resistant to errors.   
#### Q7. Why is every windows solution "Have you tried restarting?" And why does that always work?   
Restarting a computer just starts everything from scratch. The computer's short term memory is lost and every thing starts in pristine condition, in exactly the way the programmers intended, as opposed to a state that just wasen't programmed properly.   
#### Q8. What's the best operating system?   
The most popular are windows and macOS. Many of today's servers run on linux. A lot of it boils down to personal preference. I wouldn't say there is one best OS, but there tends to be correlation between the OS people use and the applications they have in mind.   
#### Q9. Why aren't computers getting cheaper?   
Well, computer parts do tend to get cheaper. But our expectations keep rising, so we need them to perform to much higher levels than we're used to.   
#### Q10. Can someone explain cloud computing to me like a 5 year old?   
Cloud computing is essentially you using someone else's servers that you're paying to rent or timeshare. It's better branding of a technique that's been used for years, like google, Microsoft or Apple affording lots of servers and making them available in part to customers.  
#### Q11. How does computer memory work?   
Computer memory is like a superhero's backpack RAM is super fast but forgets things when the computer rests. It helps the computer do tasks quickly. Storage is like a treasure chest, slower but remembers everything even when the computer is off keeping all the important stuff safe for later adventures.  
#### Q12. How do you explain web3 to people?   
Web 1-3 describes phases of the internet. During web 1 and 2, data was stored centrally on a  developer's or company's server. Web3 transition away from the centralized model, with data distributed over multiple servers, creating collective ownership and verification of the data.   
#### Q13. Can someone explain to me the difference between firmware and software. Hardware is physical, software is code, WTF is firmware?   
Firmware is just software, but it comes built into your hardware. It is completely inegrated into the hardware itselt and can be changed or upgraded.
